## Kubernetes-based Alert Management System

---

##  Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the application of **Chaos Engineering principles** on a **Kubernetes-based microservice architecture** using **Chaos Mesh**.

The goal of the project is to evaluate how a distributed system behaves under controlled failure scenarios such as:

* Network latency
* CPU resource exhaustion
* Pod termination
* HTTP-level request failures

The system simulates a simplified **security alert processing pipeline**, where incoming alerts are classified according to severity while chaos experiments are actively injected.

All experiments are **documented with real execution screenshots**, as required.

---

##  Project Objectives

* Design a simple Kubernetes-based microservice system
* Apply controlled failures using Chaos Mesh CRDs
* Observe system behavior under different fault conditions
* Analyze **fault tolerance**, **self-healing**, and **fallback mechanisms**
* Document experiments with reproducible evidence (screenshots)

---

##  System Architecture

### Microservices

#### 1️⃣ Backend Service

* Exposes REST endpoint: `/generate-alert`
* Receives alert requests via HTTP
* Forwards alerts to the classifier
* Implements fallback logic if the classifier is unavailable

#### 2️⃣ Classifier Service

* Determines alert severity
* Runs as an independent Kubernetes Deployment
* Primary target of chaos experiments

#### 3️⃣ Client

* Manual testing via `curl`
* Used to observe system behavior during chaos

### Communication Flow

```
Client → Backend → Classifier
```

---

##  Technologies Used

* **Kubernetes (Minikube)**
* **Docker**
* **Python (Flask)**
* **Chaos Mesh**
* **kubectl**
* **YAML-based manifests**

---

##  Chaos Engineering Experiments

All chaos experiments target the **classifier service** and are defined under the `chaos-experiments/` directory.
Each experiment is supported by execution screenshots stored under `screenshots/`.

---

###  Experiment 1 – Baseline (No Chaos)

📁 `screenshots/01_baseline/`

Purpose:
Establish normal system behavior before injecting chaos.

Evidence:

* Running pods
* Successful curl request
* Backend logs

---

###  Experiment 2 – Network Delay (NetworkChaos)

📁 `screenshots/02_network_delay/`
📄 `network-delay-classifier.yaml`
📄 `network-delay-backend-to-classifier.yaml`

Description:

* Artificial latency injected between services
* Communication continues with increased delay
* No complete service outage observed

Observed Result:

* Backend successfully processes requests
* No timeout occurs under configured delay

---

###  Experiment 3 – HTTP Chaos (HTTPChaos)

📁 `screenshots/03_http_chaos/`
📄 `http-chaos-classifier.yaml`

Description:

* HTTP request aborts injected into classifier
* Experiment revealed **runtime incompatibility** between HTTPChaos and Docker-based container runtime

Observed Result:

* Chaos resource created successfully
* Injection failed due to container runtime mismatch
* Failure is documented and analyzed (expected technical limitation)

This experiment demonstrates **important real-world constraints** of chaos tooling.

---

###  Experiment 4 – CPU Stress (StressChaos)

📁 `screenshots/04_stress_chaos/`
📄 `stress-cpu-classifier.yaml`

Description:

* CPU load forced to 100% on classifier pod
* Service remains running but under heavy load

Observed Result:

* Curl requests still return responses
* Increased processing latency observed
* Demonstrates graceful degradation under resource pressure

---

###  Experiment 5 – Pod Kill (PodChaos)

📁 `screenshots/05_pod_kill/`
📄 `pod-kill-classifier.yaml`

Description:

* Classifier pod deliberately terminated
* Kubernetes automatically recreates the pod

Observed Result:

* Pod termination confirmed
* New pod created within seconds
* Demonstrates Kubernetes **self-healing capability**

---

###  Experiment 6 – Composite Scenario (Pod Kill + Network Delay)

📁 `screenshots/06_composite_scenario/`

Description:

* Network delay and pod kill chaos active simultaneously
* Represents a realistic multi-failure incident scenario

Observed Result:

* NetworkChaos and PodChaos active at the same time
* Classifier pod recreated successfully
* System remains operational

Note:
Due to limitations in the installed Chaos Mesh Workflow CRD, a native workflow experiment could not be applied.
Instead, a **manual composite chaos scenario** was executed, which provides equivalent analytical value.

##  Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how Chaos Engineering can be applied to a Kubernetes-based microservice system.

By injecting controlled failures using Chaos Mesh and documenting real execution results, the system’s resilience, recovery behavior, and limitations were analyzed in a practical and transparent manner.

The repository provides a **reproducible, evidence-based chaos engineering study**, aligned with academic and industry practices.
